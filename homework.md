# Bears, River, Fish

We are going to build a small ecosystem! We want to create an ecosystem made up of 3 parts: bears, river and fish. You will need a class for each of these. From this you can make instances and build your ecosystem.

## How Our Ecosystem Works

- A `River` should have a name e.g. "Amazon"
- A `River` should have a collection of `Fish` (an array)
- A `Fish` should have a name
- A `Bear` should have a name e.g. "Yogi"
- A `Bear` should have a type e.g. "Grizzly"
- A `Bear` should have a collection of food (an array)
- A `Bear` should be able to take a `Fish` from the `River` and add it to its collection of food
- A `River` should lose a `Fish` when a `Bear` takes a `Fish`

## Extensions

- A `Bear` could have a `roar` method
- A `Bear` could have a `food_count` method
- A `River` could have a `fish_count` method
